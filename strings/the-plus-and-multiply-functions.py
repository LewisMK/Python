# strings can be concatenated and replicated

# Demo

plus = "+"

asterisk = '*'

decoration = (asterisk + plus) * 10 + asterisk

print(decoration)

# Another example

firstName = "John"
lastName = "Doe"

print(firstName + lastName)

# We can put the name in the middle of the decoration

print(decoration)
